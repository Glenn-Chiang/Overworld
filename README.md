This project is a simple demonstration of the use of perlin noise to procedurally generate 2D terrain using Unity's tilemap system.

- Perlin noise is used to generate a pseudorandom distribution of height values on a grid
- We assign a tile to each cell on the grid according to the height value at that cell
